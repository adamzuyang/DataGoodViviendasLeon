The ranking of each crop corresponds to its order in the returned array (i.e. best to worst order). Uses the dictionary `comp_scores` to inform its rankings (the higher the score, the better the crop's rank).\n","- `get_best_region`: Ranks crops using composite scores based on region (if applicable). The ranking of each crop corresponds to its order in the returned array. Uses the dictionaries `reg_cond_scores` (for conditions) and `reg_dis_scores` (for percent diseased) to inform its rankings.\n","- `get_best_community`: Ranks crops using composite scores based on community (if applicable). The ranking of each crop corresponds to its order in the returned array. Uses the dictionaries `com_cond_scores` (for conditions) and `com_dis_scores` (for percent diseased) to inform its rankings.\n","- `get_best_type_composite`: Ranks crop types (e.g. \"Veg\", \"Grians\", etc.) using composite scores based on condition, percent diseased, region (if applicable), and community (if applicable). The ranking of each crop type corresponds to its order in the returned array. Uses the dictionary `type_comp_scores` to inform its rankings (the higher the score, the better the crop type's rank).\n","- `get_best_type_region`: Ranks crop types using composite scores based on region (if applicable). The ranking of each crop type corresponds to its order in the returned array. Uses the dictionaries `type_reg_cond_scores` (for conditions) and `type_reg_dis_scores` (for percent diseased) to inform its rankings.\n","- `get_best_type_community`: Ranks crop types using composite scores based on community (if applicable).
